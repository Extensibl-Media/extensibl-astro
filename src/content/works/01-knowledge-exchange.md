### 1. The Challenge

Knowledge Exchange is a growing community fo scholars, professors, and professionals, all with the shared interest of free and open knowledge sharing in their respective professions. When they came to us as a client, they were hoping to build upon their already great platform with some new and engaging features that are necessary in an online community.

Their platform is build on standard web tech, utilizing React for their front end and Google's Firebase as a backend and authentication provider. This combination allows for a very flexible approach to adding new features without much friction, and helps them scale easier, which was their ultimate goal.

### 2. The Solution

New releases allowed for an opportunity to build upon their landing page, and a redesign was in order to highlight the newer features as well as showcase some of the content the platform stakeholders generate as a means of engaging with members and the public alike.

Strategizing with stakeholders from Knowledge Exchange, we were able to deliver to them amazing new features such as in app private and group messaging, the ability to "Meet Now" with professionals, known as "Givers" on the knowledge Exchange, as well as a new Discussions feature, a feature that is similar to forum threads.

### 3. The Result

These additions helped the platform grow and attract new members to build upon their goal of keeping knowledge open for all who seek it. Their member count has grown substantially, and continues to grow as they now shift their efforts to effective marketing to get the word out about their new and improved platform features.

We will continue to help Knowledge Exchange as partners in building upon their business and brand for the foreseeable future, and look forward to any new ideas they have to bring more accessibility to knowledge.
